Ludum Dare 30 - theme 'Connected Worlds'

# Brainstorming
Ideas

## Jumping back and forth between worlds
 
  * Close to what we had with Heavy Drizzle
  * Probably what most people will pick
 
## "Get your ass to Mars"
 
  * Need to terraform / colonize a planet
  * Shuttle makes constant repeating trips back and forth
  * Need to launch payloads to be picked up
  * Limited payload size
  * Need to balance replenishing resources / building new terraforming equipment, and ferrying people back and forth.
  * Goal is to move entire population
  * What is difficult?  What will make people play differently?
   
## Linked characters

  * Two characters in split screen, wandering.
  * Controls move both at once
  * Need to run one into walls, etc, to make them line up correctly
  
## Orbiting planets

  * Place planets aside a gravity well
  * They start with a velocity and begin to orbit
  * Try to place more planets, all gravity calculated to adjust orbits
  * Planets can fly off into space, collide with each other, fly into sun
  * What's the point of the game?  Try to get X planets in a stable orbit?
